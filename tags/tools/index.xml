      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, my girlfriend bought me a STM32F103 board to play around with that has a RS-232 serial port on it to program it. Since I haven&amp;rsquo;t owned any computer in the last few years that has a serial port, I needed to get a converter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been inhaling a little too much flux fumes so I decided that I needed a fume extractor. I saw a lot of DIY fume extractors on the web but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t satisfied with the performance of those extractors. A lot of the demonstrations showed that you had to be within 2 inches of the fan in order for it to work properly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
