      <description>&lt;p&gt;At church, we have a projector that is close to the ceiling and far away from the audio/video booth. The remote control that came with the projector does not have a very far range. I have to get out of the booth and walk close to the back row and keep moving the remote until I get the projector to turn off or on. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t only annoying for me, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure it was distracting for the church members.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
