      <title>Bitpim contacts CSV to google voice/gmail CSV</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/googlevoice/about.html&#34;&gt;Google Voice&lt;/a&gt; for a while and I wanted to transfer my list of contacts from my phone to it. So, I decided to make a simple python script to convert the CSV contacts export from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bitpim.org/&#34;&gt;Bitpim&lt;/a&gt; to something that Google voice could import.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently bought a Nokia 6100 LCD from Ebay because I am in an LCD craze phase. Since I have no need for this LCD right now, I decided to port some code over to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=9148&#34;&gt;PIC24H minibully&lt;/a&gt; from Sparkfun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Simple sanguino clock prototype</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to make my own alarm clock for some time now, since I&amp;rsquo;m unsatisfied with any alarm clock on the market (neglecting overpriced ones). I just made a quick prototype to see if I liked it or not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a script I made a long time ago when &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.heroesofnewerth.com/&#34;&gt;Heroes of Newerth&lt;/a&gt; first released its beta. It simply retrieves all of the player&amp;rsquo;s statistics given their player name.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>STM32 4-bit LCD library</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a 4-bit LCD library for the STM32 that I based off of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Code/LCD4BitLibrary&#34;&gt;LCD4BitLibrary&lt;/a&gt; for Arduino. It&amp;rsquo;s lightweight, but it also incorporates Arduino&amp;rsquo;s Print class.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Speeding up the Sanguino reset time</title>
      <link>https://blog.kevindarlington.com/2010/02/26/speeding-up-the-sanguino-reset-time/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.kevindarlington.com/2010/02/26/speeding-up-the-sanguino-reset-time/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to use a &lt;a href=&#34;http://sanguino.cc/&#34;&gt;Sanguino&lt;/a&gt; for my next project and I noticed that every time I reset it with the pushbutton, it would take around 10 seconds to start the program. I thought this was absurd since the regular Arduino doesn&amp;rsquo;t take that long. I decided to dive into the bootloader firmware and find out the problem. The Sanguino version I&amp;rsquo;m dealing with is v1.4 r1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At church, we have a projector that is close to the ceiling and far away from the audio/video booth. The remote control that came with the projector does not have a very far range. I have to get out of the booth and walk close to the back row and keep moving the remote until I get the projector to turn off or on. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t only annoying for me, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure it was distracting for the church members.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Valentine&#39;s Day 8x8 RGB LED</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided this year to make a 8x8 RGB LED device to give to my girlfriend for Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day. I had made her a heart of red LEDs two years ago and I decided to step it up a little. No, this was not a cheap solution (it cost around $100 in materials, including all the stuff I bought that I ended up not using). I spent more time on this thing than anything I have made before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t buy cheap USB to RS232 converters</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, my girlfriend bought me a STM32F103 board to play around with that has a RS-232 serial port on it to program it. Since I haven&amp;rsquo;t owned any computer in the last few years that has a serial port, I needed to get a converter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Airwick motion sensor PIR with an arduino</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve obtained two Airwick Freshmatics from a yard sale for $2. These were used in my house for a while, but it quickly became annoying to be sprayed in the face every time.  So I decided to hook it up to my arduino for no reason whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a few projects that I worked on that I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet made open source. Most of them I don&amp;rsquo;t actively develop anymore. Below is a list of these projects and what they are. You can find all of my source code at &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/kdar/&#34;&gt;http://github.com/kdar/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My computer setup at home involves two computers. The first computer is my quad core workhorse. I do all my programming and gaming on this machine. My second computer is my chat/fileserver machine. I use this primiarly as a backup computer and so I can talk to people while gaming or programming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At church, we have a projector device that is hooked up to the computer that allows us to show words to a song or a video. The problem is the VGA to composite converter we have does not have a button to black out the projector. So, when I go to get a video ready to be shown, the whole congregation sees what I&amp;rsquo;m doing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A long time ago (a few years), I used to play a lot of counter-strike with a few friends. We used to do a lot of scrimmages and matches (cal-m). One thing we were tired of was having to find a scrim via IRC. My brilliant friend, James, decided to make a tool that would automatically find scrims for us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://blog.kevindarlington.com/2009/12/01/high-performance-diy-fume-extractor/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been inhaling a little too much flux fumes so I decided that I needed a fume extractor. I saw a lot of DIY fume extractors on the web but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t satisfied with the performance of those extractors. A lot of the demonstrations showed that you had to be within 2 inches of the fan in order for it to work properly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
