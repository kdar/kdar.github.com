I've had [Google Voice](http://www.google.com/googlevoice/about.html) for a while and I wanted to transfer my list of contacts from my phone to it. So, I decided to make a simple python script to convert the CSV contacts export from [Bitpim](http://www.bitpim.org/) to something that Google voice could import. <!--more-->This code is not exhaustive whatsoever.
