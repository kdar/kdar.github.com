This is an application that will help you in generating codes for the program [TMorph](http://www.ownedcore.com/forums/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-bots-programs/375925-tmorph-64-bit-morpher-panda-support.html). Get [MorphGEN here](https://github.com/kdar/morphgen-binary).

It supports the following websites:

  + [http://www.wowhead.com/](http://www.wowhead.com/) - retrieve from item sets, item comparisons, and transmog sets
  + [http://us.battle.net/wow/](http://us.battle.net/wow/) - retrieve from person's armory
  + [http://wowroleplaygear.com/](http://wowroleplaygear.com/) - transmog sets
  + [http://mogmygear.com/](http://mogmygear.com/) - transmog sets
  + [http://www.worldofwardrobes.net](http://www.worldofwardrobes.net) - transmog sets
  + [http://www.wowmogging.com](http://www.wowmogging.com) - transmog sets

I've also been testing out a new interface. Not sure if I'm going to release it or not, because it depends on a web browser (using Chrome in application mode in this case).

I could eventually release it as a web application so people don't have to download anything. We'll see.
