I've been wanting to make my own alarm clock for some time now, since I'm unsatisfied with any alarm clock on the market (neglecting overpriced ones). I just made a quick prototype to see if I liked it or not.

#### Parts used


  * [Sanguino](http://www.moderndevice.com/products/sanguino) from Moderndevice

  * [20x4 LCD](http://www.moderndevice.com/products/20x4-blue-lcd) from Moderndevice

  * [Electronic brick real time clock module](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/electronic-brick-real-time-clock-moduleds1307-p-491.html?cPath=48_59) from Seedstudio

  * [Electronic brick temperature sensor](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/electronic-brick-temperature-sensoranalog-p-478.html?cPath=48_52) from Seeedstudio

  * [Electronic brick fully buckled 4 wire cable](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/electronic-brick-fully-buckled-4-wire-cable-p-486.html?cPath=48_57) from Seedstudio

  * [Electronic brick fully buckled 3 wire cable](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/electronic-brick-fully-buckled-3-wire-cable-p-485.html?cPath=48_57) from Seedstduio

  * [Dual-female jumper wires](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/1-pin-dualfemale-jumper-wire-100mm-50pcs-pack-p-260.html?cPath=34) from Seedstudio

  * 1k trimpot for contrast adjustment


I also used a [USB BUB Board](http://www.moderndevice.com/products/usb-bub) from Moderndevice to program the Sanguino. I have to say, I really LOVE these two companies. They have great products at great prices, and their tech support is phenomenal (I've had to use them both).


#### Source code


[clock.zip](/downloads/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/clock.zip)

There is no alarm code inside the source. I was merely just testing to see if I would like the setup or not.


#### Conclusion


In my real design, I don't think I want to use a 20x4 character LCD as it is very hard to tell the time from a distance. I'll be looking into either a monochrome graphic LCD or a color LCD.

Feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions.
